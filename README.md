# Introductory Ruby

This repo contains introductory Ruby exercises and programmes that I have
completed or written. These exercises come variously from the Makers
Academy Course, Ruby Kickstart, and my own imagination. I will add to this repo
as and when I do more exercises.

## Table of Contents
- equanimity.rb
  - A programme that illustrates the theory of equanimity in meditation. This
  was created for my blog post [And That's Okay](https://blog.makersacademy.com/and-thats-okay-bfc9ace2ddde).

- fib.rb
  - A recursion exercise taken from Ruby Kickstart Session 3.

- hello_world.rb
  - A classic that needs no explanation.
  - 06/05/2020 - now updated to print its own source code using File class
  methods. 

- reverse_append.rb
  - Another recursion exercise from Ruby Kickstart Session 3.
